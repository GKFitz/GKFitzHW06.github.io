This app utilizes the Open Weather API to check the weather around the world. The user is able to search by city which will present them with that cities current weather, including an icon, temperature, humidity and windspeed. It also includes the UV index, which is color coded based on the severity of the score, matching with the EPA UV index color spectrum. The app also includes the basic 5 day forecast for that city which includes an icon, temperature and humidity. All of the searches are saved to local storage and the list under the search bar, ordered with the most recent search on the top of the list. If the user want to see one of their old searches they can just clisk on the listed city. There is also a clear button to erase the lists, to start again. The app updates based on the current date.
